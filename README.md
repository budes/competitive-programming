What i am studying and anything related to competitive programming, trying to keep it updated from time to time

# What i am doing now

Studying competitive programming, mainly the topics i haven't studied in my advanced algorithms classes.
I'm using [this](https://gcc-cefetmg.github.io/escPrimavera.html) as my main source to organize my studies.

So to keep it updated i will translate everything to here:
- [x] [Árvore Binária (Binary Tree)](theory/BinaryTree.md) 
- [ ] [Árvore de Fenwick (Binary Indexed Tree – BIT)](theory/FenwickTreeBIT.md)
- [ ] Árvore de Segmentos (SegTree)
- [ ] Árvore de Prefixos (Trie)
